Applescript functions and scripts that I use to automate my mac.

The general functions are stored in the "library" folder. 
This folder is meant to be aliased as "Script Libraries" 
and put into the Library folder so that the underlying functions can be seen system wide 
(see https://macosxautomation.com/mavericks/libraries/index.html).

Scripts that are dedicated to a specific task are stored in the "script" folder
and are meant to be used using automator, as a service or an applet.
